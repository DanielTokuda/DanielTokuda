### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel and I am a MSc student in Applied Mathematics at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IME-USP)](https://www.ime.usp.br) and member of the institute's biomathematics ressearch group [BIOMAT](https://sites.google.com/ime.usp.br/biomat/pÃ¡gina-inicial). I am currently working on applying scientific machine learning algorithms - more specifically Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) - in compartmental epidemic models. Other subjects that interest me are control theory, ordinary differential equations, mathematical origami and geometric tessellations.

Feel free to contact me at daniel.tokuda@usp.br or check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielyujitokuda/) for more information.
